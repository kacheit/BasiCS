<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>A <b>Linkedlist</b> is a data structure that can contain an infinite amount of elements (theoretically if given an infinite amount of storage). It is superior to the Array because it does not need to resize if you run out of allocated space. It can keep allocating new nodes, and create a chain of elements. For the sake of simplicity, we'll be only discussing Singly-linked lists</p>

<hr />

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data structure for an LinkedList looks something like (in pseudocode): </p>

<pre><code>class LinkedList {
	Node head;
	Node tail;

	search(Node);
	append(Node);
	remove(Node);
}</code></pre>

<p>First thing is to note that the class has a reference to only the head and tail. The tail is kept in record because it would make the append operation much more efficient. In a <i>pure</i> and <i>minimalist</i> Linkedlist, you would just need a reference to the <code>Node</code> class (below).</p>

<br />

<p>The <code>Node</code> data structure looks something like:</p>

<pre><code>class Node{
	Data data;
	Node next = NULL;
}</code></pre>

<p><code>Data</code> can be anything you want to store, such as a integer or String or even a custom object you created. Notice that the <code>Node</code> has a field for another <code>Node</code> named <code>next</code>. This is the element that succeeds the current <code>Node</code>. It's default value is <code>NULL</code> because the current node doesn't necessarily have a next data, it might be the <b>end of the LinkedList</b>.</p>

<p>Did you remember those weird functions like <code>search(Node)</code>? Let's cover them. Remember these are the essential functions for any Data Structure and you can make your own custom functions as well.</p>

<br />

<h4>Search</h4>

<pre><code>boolean search(Node n) {
	Node current = head;

	while (current != NULL) {
		if (current == n) {
			return true;
		}
		current = current.next;
	}

	return false;
}	
</code></pre>

<p>The idea behind this function is we march along each <code>Node</code> and check if the current <code>Node</code> matches the node we are searching for. If we reach the end of the <code>Linkedlist</code>, (which is when the next <code>Node</code> is <code>NULL</code>, we know the element is not in the <code>Linkedlist</code> because we searched every element.</p>

<br />

<h4>Append</h4>

<pre><code>void append(Node n){
	tail.next = n; // The current tail makes reference to new node
	tail = n; //The NEW tail Node is the appended node
}</code></pre>

<p>This function is quite short. You simply just change the current <code>tail</code>'s next element to the added element. Then you change the reference of the <code>tail</code> to the newly added <code>Node</code>.</p>

<br />

<h4>Remove</h4>

<pre><code>void remove(Node n) {
	Node current = head;
	Node prev;

	if (head == n) {
		head = head.next;
		return;
	}

	do {
		prev = current;
		current = current.next;

		if (current == n) {
			//Time to remove current node
			prev.next = current.next; //Relink
			return;
		}

	} while (current != NULL);
}</code></pre>

<p>This one is a bit tricky, since we have to deal with <b>3 cases</b>. The first being that we have to remove the current <code>head</code>, then we simply change the given <code>Node n</code>'s <code>next</code> to be the same as the old <code>head</code>'s <code>next</code>. The second case is if we find that the desired element to remove is in the middle to end of the linked list, which we have to keep track of the previous node and relink the previous node to <i>skip</i> the removed <code>Node</code>. The third and last case is if the <code>Node n</code> was not even in the list, which we will just end the function after reaching the <code>tail</code> of the linkedlist.</p>
